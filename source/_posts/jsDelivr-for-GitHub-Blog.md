Iâ€™v been wanting to optimize my blogâ€™s loading speed for a long time. However, even when I rewrote my theme, I still didnâ€™t do it.

<!--more-->

Finally, I want to post a new article with many imagesâ€¦(bla bla blaâ€¦)

I found that **jsDelivr** is great according to e-friends from the website.

At first Iâ€™m confused of getting an account of it. Ha Ha Ha. It just needs no account.

Since Iâ€™m using accelerating for GitHub, just add the prefix before original url:

`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Github_username/repo_name` and follow the actual path of the file in your repo.

Itâ€™s just that easyâ€¦â€¦

Iâ€™ve been funny for such a long time. (awkwardðŸ˜‚)

Last time I‘ve talked about how to build your own blog, however, the original theme might not very beautiful to you. So this time I would write how to change your blog theme and others.

The first thing is to find a beautiful theme of hexo, find it’s repo on github.

This is the theme my blog based on. Then click the green button **Clone or download**. Then copy the url.

Click the button to copy the url.

Then open the Cmder, find the directory of your blog and type:

```
λ git clone url
```

Now you can find the file of the blog under the file themes. Remember the name and open the _config.yml and find themes.

Change landscape into your theme name. hexo s to preview and hexo g and hexo d.

If you are still not very satisfy with your theme, you can looks in its files and modify the css or js files.
